> Objective is to classify the dataset (question based) into four categories: Who, What, When, Affirmation(Y/N). Label any sentence that does no fall in any of the above four as "Unknown" type.

## Techniques Used 
> I have used naive bayes and deeplearning using LSTM.

## Accuracy Matrix
> Naive Bayes : 90% \
> LSTM: 98.5%


### Requirements for running notebooks:
