> We are about to classify the dataset(question based) into four classification: Who, What, When, Affirmation(Y/N). Label any sentence that does no fall in any of the above four as "Unknown" type.

## Techniques Used
> I have used naive bias and deeplearning using LSTM.

## Accuracy Matrix
> Naive Bayes : 90%
> LSTM: 98.5%
